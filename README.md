# Email Automation

## Project Information

Often times executives on campus clubs opt to send a non-personalized email when notifying candidates on their status for a leadership position they applied for. This lack of extra effort can damage how students perceive the club. As a result, Email Automation's goal is to help campus clubs maintain their image and to help executives send personalized emails without sacrificing unecessary time.
